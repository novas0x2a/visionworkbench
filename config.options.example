### config.options.example
#
# This file demonstrates how to configure the NASA Vision Workbench 
# in various ways.  To use it, rename or copy it to "config.options" 
# and uncomment or modify the appropriate lines below.


### Configure Options
#
# Alternative command-line syntax:  --enable-foo[=val]
#
# These options allow you modify the basic behavior of the build
# environment.

# ENABLE_DEBUG=no
# ENABLE_OPTIMIZE=yes
# PREFIX=/foo/bar


### Module Configuration
#
# Alternative command-line syntax:  --enable-module-foo[=val]
#
# Uncomment the following lines to explicitly enable or disable
# certain modules.  These options override the default behavior, which
# is to build all modules that can be built with the libraries that
# you have installed on your system.  Note that no module will be
# built if its required software dependencies cannot be found.  Look
# at the output from ./configure to see what modules will ultimately
# be built.

# ENABLE_MODULE_MOSAIC=yes
# ENABLE_MODULE_CAMERA=yes
# ENABLE_MODULE_CARTOGRAPHY=yes
# ENABLE_MODULE_HDR=yes


### Package Base Paths 
#
# Alternative command-line syntax:  --with-paths=val
#
# Set these to the directories that contain lib/include directories
# for packages in non-standard locations.  List multiple search 
# directories by seperating them with whitespace.  

# PKG_PATHS="/foo/bar"

### Using pkg-config or *-config
#
# The only upstream-supported method of detecting some libraries is through the
# (new-style) pkg-config or (old-style) *-config (ex: gdal-config) scripts.
#
# Our build system doesn't support this directly yet, but this is the way we
# support using them:
#
# PKG_GDAL_CPPFLAGS=$(gdal-config --cflags)
# PKG_GDAL_LIBS=$(gdal-config --libs)
#
# or
#
# PKG_PNG_CPPFLAGS=$(pkg-config --cflags libpng)
# PKG_PNG_LIBS=$(pkg-config --libs libpng)
